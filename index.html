    <h2>How To Make Lasagna</h2>
    
<p>The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly customizable, 
    so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true 
    to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your 
    grocery list:</p>

    <p><strong>MEAT:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean 
    ground beef.</p>
<p><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the 
    meat to add tons of flavor.</p>

<p><strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of 
    tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</p>
    
<p><strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance 
    the flavor of the sauce.</p>
        
<p><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh 
    parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</p>
            
<p><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</p>
                
<p><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna 
    extra decadent.</p>
                    
<p><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the 
    lasagna when you cut into it.</p>
