<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ cup honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>8 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>3 eggs, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon poppy seeds (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    
<p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can 
    expect when you make challah bread at home:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Activate the yeast.</li>
    <li>Make the dough.</li>
    <li>Turn out and knead the dough.</li>
    <li>Let the dough rise.</li>
    <li>Roll and braid the dough according to the below directions.</li>
    <li>Let the dough rise again.</li>
    <li>Add an egg wash and sprinkle with poppy seeds.</li>
    <li>Bake the challah bread until golden brown.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to Braid Challah</h2>

<p>Once your dough has risen, divide into three equal pieces and gently roll into 11/2-inch-thick 
    ropes with the palms of your hands (the ropes should be about the same length). Pinch the 
    ropes together at one end and braid fairly tightly. Pinch the opposite ends together. Tuck the 
    ends underneath the loaf.</p>

<h2>How to Store Challah</h2>

<p>Place your challah in a resealable bag and press out all the air before sealing. Freeze for up 
    to three months or leave on your counter to enjoy all week. The oil and the extra eggs in 
    challah bread help it stay soft longer than other loaves. And when it starts to go stale, 
    it's time for bread pudding or French toast!</p>

<h2>How to Use Challah</h2>

<p>Challah can absorb lots of liquid without falling apart, making it perfect for a custardy bread 
    pudding, French toast, or even your Thanksgiving stuffing. Use challah in simple sandwiches 
    (peanut butter and jelly is a fave) but skip it for sandwiches that need something sturdier, 
    like a grilled cheese or a sandwich with lots of heavy fillings.</p>
